# Features

### Asks

With Plural, users can request help for planned or unexpected expenses. These requests are referred to as Asks and have properties such as a deadline, a target amount, and instructions how to help.

### Sponsoring

When users send money to others it is referred to as sponsoring an Ask. There's no minimum or maximum amount, or limit on how many times an Ask can be sponsored.
