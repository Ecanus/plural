# Features

### Asks

With Plural, users can request for help with planned or unexpected expenses. These requests are referred to as Asks and have attributes such as deadlines, instructions for sponsoring, and the target amount.

### Sponsoring

When users send money to others it's referred to as sponsoring an Ask. There's no minimum or maximum amount, or limit, on how many times an Ask can be sponsored.
