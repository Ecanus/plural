# Contributing to the Plural app

We're so grateful for your interest in the Plural app!
As a contributor, here are the guidelines we all follow:

 - [Code of Conduct](#coc)
 - [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
 - [Submission Guidelines](#submit)
 - [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit)


## <a name="coc"></a> Code of Conduct

Help us keep the Plural app open and inclusive.
Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct][coc].


## <a name="issue"></a> Issues and Bugs

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help out by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to our [GitHub Repository][github].


## <a name="submit"></a> Submission Guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker. An issue for your problem might already exist and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

Before fixing a bug, we need to reproduce and confirm it.
In order to reproduce bugs, we require that you provide a minimal reproduction.
Having a minimal reproducible scenario gives us important information without having to contact to you with additional questions.

A minimal reproduction allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out a coding problem) as well as confirm that we are fixing the right problem.

Unfortunately, we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduction.

You can file new issues by selecting from our [new issue templates](https://github.com/Ecanus/plural/issues/new/choose) and filling out the issue template.


## <a name="commit"></a> Commit Message Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our Git commit messages must be formatted:
```
<type>: <short summary>
```

See [Commit Message Guidelines][commit-message-guidelines] for details.
