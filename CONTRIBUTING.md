## <a name="coc"></a> Code of Conduct

Help us keep the Plural app open and inclusive.
Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct][coc].


## <a name="issue"></a> Issues and Bugs

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help out by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to our [GitHub Repository][github].
Even better, you can [submit a Pull Request](#submit-pr) with a fix.


## <a name="feature"></a> Feature Requests
You can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to our GitHub Repository.


## <a name="submit"></a> Submission Guidelines


### <a name="submit-issue"></a> Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker. An issue for your problem might already exist and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug, we need to reproduce and confirm it.
In order to reproduce bugs, we require that you provide a minimal reproduction.
Having a minimal reproducible scenario gives us a wealth of important information without going back and forth to you with additional questions.

A minimal reproduction allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out a coding problem) as well as confirm that we are fixing the right problem.

We require a minimal reproduction to save maintainers' time and ultimately be able to fix more bugs.
Often, developers find coding problems themselves while preparing a minimal reproduction.
We understand that sometimes it might be hard to extract essential bits of code from a larger codebase, but we really need to isolate the problem before we can fix it.

Unfortunately, we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduction, so if we don't hear back from you, we are going to close an issue that doesn't have enough info to be reproduced.

You can file new issues by selecting from our [new issue templates](https://github.com/Ecanus/plural/issues) and filling out the issue template.


## <a name="commit"></a> Commit Message Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our Git commit messages must be formatted:
```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
```

See [Commit Message Guidelines][commit-message-guidelines] for details.
